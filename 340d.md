# The World's Most Expensive Terminal Emulator

*The Hacker’s Dictionary* is a book chock full with hacker culture and
PDP-10 lore. Ever since reading it as a child, I have been fascinated
by PDP-10 computers in general, and ITS—the Incompatible Timesharing
System—in particular. Back in the old ARPANET days, ITS was well known
and for a long time it retained a mythical status in discussions
reminiscing on the Internet. Many important technologies were
pioneered or developed on ITS: Lisp, AI, Macsyma, Logo and turtle
graphics, Emacs, Scheme, Zork. Over the years my interest has grown
even deeper, and I have been working on restoring it to some of its
former glory by locating programs, building them from source code, and
making them available for people to explore. Aiding in this, MIT has
given me access to decades of PDP-10 backup tapes to do research.

During its heyday, ITS ran on four PDP-10 machines at MIT. The one
featured in this article also had an older PDP-6 attached. The two
machines shared a Type 340 vector display. Users would normally log in
from Datapoint 3300 terminals, where they met with a terse but highly
effective user interface: the DDT debugger. Each user had their own
directory, but there were no subdirectories! A full file name looks
like A; B C, where the semicolon terminates the directory name, and
the two other strings name the file. That’s right, a file has two
names. The second name can be anything, but conventionally a type or
version number.

ITS was created in the freewheeling atmosphere of MIT’s AI lab. Far
from being a model of organization—actually, quite the opposite—there
are many nooks and crannies to search. I had been seeing references to
something called 340D, but I didn’t quite understand what it was. I
decided to go spelunking.

The file SYSDOC; ITSTTY 41 mentions a terminal type called 340D: "*the
340D program does a CNSSET to the sty it uses, setting it to be a
datapoint with a peculiar screen size. This causes ITS to send
datapoint cursor motion codes to the tty. The 340D program reads them
from the sty and simulates their effect in the display that it
maintains on the 340.*"

What is this 340D program? Searching backups and file listings
revealed nothing.

The .INFO.; TCTYP ORDER file agrees: "*340D - Declares the terminal to
be the 340 datapoint simulator.*" And the source code for TCTYP
specifies the screen size to be 80 columns by 40 lines. Apparently
it’s some kind of terminal emulator!

Finally I find a trace. A backup listing includes a link from SYS1; TS
340D to STAN.K; MOD11 BIN. But it's a dangling link—MOD11 BIN was not
backed up, and indeed there is no file named MOD11 anywhere.

But there's a clue: STAN.K turns out to be Stan Kugell who was at MIT
and later the Stanford AI Lab. I contact Stan and ask about 340D, not
expecting him to remember much after more than forty years. But not
only does Stan remember his 340D program quite vividly, he's one of
the few who remembers the 340 display was accompanied by a keyboard
from the Stanford AI lab. And on top of that, 340D could make use of
that keyboard.

Stan also tells me 340D ran on the PDP-6. As such, this might be the
most expensive terminal emulator in history. A $300,000 mainframe—in
1965 dollars!—emulating a lowly Datapoint terminal. He wrote "*there
was a chronic shortage of free terminals at the lab, and the PDP-6 sat
idle or was running KLH’s Spacewar most of the time, so using it for a
terminal was both a laugh (an absurdly extravagant use of an entire
PDP-6 and display) and also practical solution.*"

Since this sounds like both a useful and fun program to have, I set
out to recreate it from what little information there is. I make it
simple—just a normal PDP-10 program running in timesharing and using
ITS' built-in 340 display list facility. When the first revision is
done, I also update the PDP-10 emulator to receive keyboard events
from the 340 window and feed them to ITS using the keyboard I/O bus
hardware device. This device can only handle one single
keyboard—evidence that it was a one-off thing, possibly only used to
get Stanford's CAD program SUDS running.

Months later I stumble across a rather innocuous looking file named
3406 40. Just a series of numbers, nothing to be excited about...
except it's in the STAN.K directory. And if you read the first file
name just so it looks like "340 6", maybe even "340 PDP-6". When I see
the file, I'm first disappointed. Sure, it does poke the 340 display,
but it's so short it can't possibly have anything to do with 340D.
Still, since it's Stan's work, I send the file to him. He agrees:
"*looks like maybe a fragment of some test/debug thing.*"

I push it to the side, but when I later examine it more closely my
interest is piqued. I see a table converting ASCII character codes to
the codes used by the Type 342 character generator. This piece of
hardware was an optional part of the 340 display, and was responsible
for converting 6-bit character codes to electronic pulses understood
by the display.

Some sites, like the Pennsylvania State University, which had quite
possibly the last operational KA10 and 340 display, couldn't afford
the 342 and had to painstakingly write code to draw all characters
vector by vector. MIT not only had the 342, they also had the
additional second set of 64 characters allowing the luxury of lower
case letters.

I read the 3406 program very closely, and now I see it's all there.
There is one buffer for 7-bit ASCII characters, 80 characters wide and
40 lines high. Just like TCTYP said. And another one for converted
6-bit characters using the 340 codes. The program cleverly checks
whether screen lines are flagged for updates, and only redraws those.

I hurriedly move the file onto my ITS system and assemble it with
MIDAS, the MIT assembler. As usual with programs this age, an older
version of the assembler does a better job, but apart from that 3406
assembles cleanly. I load it onto the PDP-6, and have my DDT make an
inferior job called "PDP6".

In ITS, subprocesses are called inferior jobs, and they are tagged
with a name rather than a numerical ID. If you name a job "PDP6", a
special feature kicks in. This job now accesses the core memory of the
PDP-6, rather than a virtual address range in ITS. This is very handy
for running and debugging code on the PDP-6.

Since my recreated 340D doesn't yet talk to 3406, I use DDT to write
information directly to the data structures in the running PDP-6
program. I use DDT's `$$1"` command to enter ASCII text—not one I
regularly use, so I have to look it up first. I write "HELLO WORLD" in
the input text buffer. Nothing happens yet, because the line isn't
flagged for an update. As soon as I type `FLAGS/ -1,,$Q`, the magic
happens. The 340 display merrily greets the universe. And the 3406
program does its job once again after so many decades.

Finally the mysterious references to the 340D have been thoroughly
explained.

Later, I update my recreated 340D to talk to 3406 running on a PDP-6,
so this program is now available for people to try and explore for
themselves. And maybe, just maybe, if someone is running ITS on an
emulator and finds themselves out of free terminal lines, they can use
the otherwise idle 340 display to log in.
